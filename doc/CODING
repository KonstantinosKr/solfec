Few simple rules:

1. Use three-letter file names (with an exeption for solfec.*)

2. Use lowercase names for public routines having simple type arguments

3. Use short all-uppercae type names, shadowed by descriptive all-lowercase structure names

4. Use uppercase prefices for driver routines of types
