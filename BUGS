Sweep algorithms get stuck when run on many cpus (e.g. -np 8 with mpi1.py and N=20)
GUESS: insertion sort is run on badly ordered sets with O(n ^2) complexity

Running drum.py in parallel exposes a contact detection bug: some boxes are
not tested for intersection and balls are left to interpenetrate the case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MESH_Hex assignes surface identifiers in a wrong manner
---------------------------------------------------------
Reading of files larger than 0xffffffff (32-bit unsigned int)
cannot seemingly work with XDR at all. Reconsider HDF.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that during W assembly when using MX_Matmat (coef, ...)
the assembly takes much longer than when scaling after (like now).
Investigate why!

SET_Delete_Node and MAP_Delete_Node do not seem to be correct
in terms of returning the next node in turn (valgrinded out)
