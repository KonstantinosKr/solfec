Sweep algorithms get stuck when run on many cpus (e.g. -np 8 with mpi1.py and N=20)
GUESS: insertion sort is run on badly ordered sets with O(n ^2) complexity

MESH_Hex assignes surface identifiers in a wrong manner

Investigate why!

SET_Delete_Node and MAP_Delete_Node do not seem to be correct
in terms of returning the next node in turn (valgrinded out)
